# ChessGame

This is a project I did in Software Methodology where we had to create a simulation of the game of Chess. 

The approach was to create a class for the board, a class for a tile, and seperate classes for each piece type that all extend a single Piece.java class.

The main method is located "in Chess.java". 

Project Grade: 100/100
